# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
For this project, we were hired by the ride-sharing. python-based, app company called Pyber. They were looking for a data analyst who could undartake the exploratory analysis on data regarding their rides in different cities. The goal is to better understand the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders who use the app. As well as to obtain relevant information regarding total fares, riders and drivers by the type of city they live in.

Overall, our goal was to provide to Pyber a complete analysis, with helful visualizations that can help them improve their access to ride_sharing services and to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 


## Results: 

Using images obtained from our analysis, we will describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

First of all we can see impactful differences between the amount of rides  and their average fares when comparing urban, rural and suburban cities.

According to our bubble chart, urban cities have more rides and cheaper fares than the rest of the city types. Another important insight to mention is that rural cities suffer from very high fare averages, which might be due to the fact that they have very few rides. We will explore possible explanations next.  

In the next three graphs, we will be able to have a clear look at the driver count data, the ride fare data and the ride count data based on the different city types: urban, rural and suburban.

As we can see, the average ride count difference between urban and rural cities is almost 20 times over. Suburban cities are a aproximate halfway point between the other two categories. On the other hand, when it comes to rida fares, the opposite is true because rural cities have over 10 times higher fares than urban cities. Suburban cities, though, maintain their middle ground spot. Lastly, we can confirm that a possible explanation as to why rural cities have such high fare rates is that they have very few drivers. That means that fewer people are around to get the job done, and the price for the services tends to increase. 

There is another way of looking at our data. We came up with pie charts to help us understand further.

First of all, we can see that more than half of the fares, specifically 62.7% of them, were paid in urban cities compared to the 30.5% paid in suburban areas and a mere 6.8% paid in rural communities. 
Next we can look through the visual data regarding the percent of total rides. As the graph shows, 68.4% of the rides where taken in rural cities. 26.3% where taken in suburban areas and 5.3% in rural areas. However, the next graph gives us interesting insights that, put together with the total rides, lead us to important conclusions.
It is no surprise to see that urban cities have the most drivers, (80.9%.). Since population in general is more dense in urbanized areas, this is not surprising. However, it is still important to recognize that rural areas only have 2.6% of the Pyber drivers, which leaves these communities underserved and with higher than average fares. 

Finally, one last look at the total fare obtained by city type shows the disparity between the three categories. Rural cities hardly gained $500, while suburban and urban areas gained, generally, over $1,000. Of course, urban cities had very high results, mostly over $2,000.

## Summary: 
Based on the results and conclusions previously stated, we will be making three recommendations that we believe will help Pyber improve their operations. 
### 1) Employ more drivers for rural and suburban areas. 
If we increase the supply, ride fares will tend to decrease. If we make ride fares more attractive for users, they will more likely use Pyber as their ride-sharing service provider.

### 2) Marketing viewpoint.
As a complementary strategy, a more specific marketing campaing, along with special discounts or bonuses, that targets users in those two city types could increase market share and name recognition. 

### 3) Distance coverage.
Developing further analysis in relation to distance covered during rides could explain why rural cities have higher rates. If they are generally covering larger distances than average city rides, they are spending more resources such as time and gas to drive users to their destinations. Taking this into consideration would be important to see how can Pyber provide additional support or economic compensation to their drivers for their work, making working for Pyber a more attractive employment option.
